# 🏠 Real Estate Rental Platform (Web3 Demo)

A **responsive rental marketplace** built with **ReactJS** that showcases how property owners can list their properties and tenants can browse, book, and pay securely using **cryptocurrency**.

This is a **demo version** of our platform, serving as the foundation for a fully-featured Web3 real estate ecosystem.

## 🚀 Features

* Browse and view property listings
* Responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)
* Dark/Light mode support
* Basic property management dashboard (demo)
* Crypto-ready architecture for future integration

## ❓ What is the Rental Platform?

The **real estate industry** is being reshaped by **blockchain and cryptocurrency**. Traditional rental processes are slow, inefficient, and often lack transparency.

This project explores how **Web3 technology**—via smart contracts and decentralized payments—can transform rental transactions into **faster, more secure, and transparent experiences** for both property owners and tenants.
